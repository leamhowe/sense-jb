# 2 - Deep Learning with PyTorch

Here we introduce how to implement some deep learning methods to satellite data using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TorchGeo](https://torchgeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#module-torchgeo) - an extension to the PyTorch which consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for geospatial data.

If you are new to deep learning and want to better understand the maths behind it, 3Blue1Brown do a fantastic series of videos on neural networks:

If you are new to PyTorch before it might be useful to review the tutorials on the Pytorch website:

* [PyTorch: Learn the Basics](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
* [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)

And TorchGeo also provides a good intro to PyTorch:

* [TorchGeo: Intro to PyTorch](https://torchgeo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/pytorch.html)

TorchGeo often uses syntax from Pytorch Lightning, which could be confusing. Here is a quick tutorial on this:
