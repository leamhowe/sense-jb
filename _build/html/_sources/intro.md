## Welcome to the SENSE library of Earth Observation tutorials!

This is site to host training materials from the Satellite Data in Environmental Science â€“ Centre for Doctoral Training programme (SENSE CDT).

Python is the most popular programming language. This includes within Environmental Science and Machine Learning. And this is not without good reason: [Why Python keeps growing, explained.](https://github.blog/developer-skills/programming-languages-and-frameworks/why-python-keeps-growing-explained/)

Therefore in these tutorials we focus on using Python for geospatial applications.

This website hosts 3 books which build on each other. building from python basics, to working with geospatial data in python, to writing and implementing your very own deep learning with Eeath Observation (EO) data.
