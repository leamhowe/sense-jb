    "# 0 - Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources available within this book originate from a range of sources, [listed below](##References), and explicitly at the top of each tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome to Book 2 - Geospatial and EO Data Analysis in Python üõ∞Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "This book builds on Book 1, and introduces a selection of the many tools available within the Python ecosystem to work with geospatial data, which includes Earth Observation and satellite datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims/Book Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this book is to introduce methods of working with geospatial data in python and provide a toolkit that you can use on your own datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "This book is split into 4 chapters:\n",
    "- **Chapter 1 - Geospatial Data tools**, introduces some of the key python libraries necessary to work with geospatial data in python. \n",
    "- **Chapter 2 - EO Data Providers (under construction)**, briefly outlines some of the platforms available to source Earth Obsercation data, as there are many hosts and your choice might depend on personal preference or intended application. \n",
    "- **Chapter 3 - GEE Python**, put a focus on one of the many hosts of Earth Data, Google Earth Engine (GEE), and how this tool can be used for powerful big data processing and analysis in python.\n",
    "- **Chapter 4 - Putting it all together**, gives an end-to-end example of doing some analysis on some satellite data, piecing together many of the tools that have been covered in the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "On completion of this book you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Be able to use python libraries such as `cartopy`, `geopandas`, `rasterio`, `xarray`, and `rioxarray` to perform geospatial data processing.\n",
    "2. (**Under Development**) Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of a selection of the many different EO data platforms, ranging from primary providers (e.g. NASA EarthData, ESA Copernicus Dataspace) to 3rd party providers (e.g. [Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) and [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog)).\n",
    "3. Use the Google Earth Engine Python API to perform fast, large-scale data processing and analysis.\n",
    "4. Understand the growing geospatial python ecosystem and numerous tools for large data analysis with powerful libraries that complement each other (e.g. `xarray`, `dask`, `zarr`, `cupy`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic understanding of coding in Python (e.g. topics covered in [Book 1](/book/1_python_zero2hero/book1_overview.ipynb))"
