# 1 - Classical ML with satellite data

In this chapter we dive straight into applying machine learning techniques to satellite data. For more details on the methods it might be worth reading up online. 

There are many courses that introduce geospatial machine learning and go into detail on the theory behind these techniques. Here's a shortlist:
- [NASA ARSET ML Fundamentals](https://github.com/NASAARSET/ARSET_ML_Fundamentals) course.
    In particular, [session 1](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NASAARSET/ARSET_ML_Fundamentals/blob/main/session1/1-ML-Algorithms-Introduction-Session1.ipynb) which introduces a variety of ML algorithms.
- [GeoScience MAchine Learning Resources and Training (GeoSMART)](https://geo-smart.github.io/mlgeo-book/about_this_book/about_this_book.html) from the University of Washington.
